## Comparison & List of Desktop Environments

The below table shows a comparison of the main desktop environments available for Linux and Unix, as well as the macOS and Microsoft Windows for the sake of comparability.

For Linux (and some Unix operation systems), there are the "Big Two" desktops, KDE and GNOME, as well as many smaller ones and the option of running a stand-alone window manager.

The desktop environment "landscape" has fragmented since the controversial initial release of GNOME 3 in 2011, which spawned a number of soft and hard forks as well as newly created desktops that are nevertheless based on some of GNOME technology; these include MATE (a continuation of GNOME 2), Linux Mints Cinnamon, Soluss Budgie, elementaryOSs Pantheon, pop_OS!s COSMIC, Ubuntu Unitys UnityX, Ubuntu Kylins UKUI.

KDE only had one notable fork, Trinity, which is a continuation of KDE 3.

Other notable desktop environments not derived from either GNOME or KDE include Xfce, LXQt, Deepin Desktop, CDE, Lumina, as well as Enlightenment and its fork Moksha.
